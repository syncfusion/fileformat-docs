# How to resolve the “File does not contain workbook stream” error?

XlsIO does not support files generated prior to 97-2003 version. Hence the exception "File does not contain workbook stream" occurs. This can be checked in prior with the below code snippet. 

{% tabs %}  

{% highlight c# %}
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//To check whether the file is supported

var isSupported = application.IsSupported("Sample.xls");

excelEngine.Dispose();

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}
Dim excelEngine As New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel

'To check whether the file is supported

Dim isSupported = application.IsSupported("Sample.xls")

excelEngine.Dispose()

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight UWP %}
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//To check whether the file is supported
FileStream stream = new FileStream("Sample.xls", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
var isSupported = application.IsSupported(stream);

excelEngine.Dispose();
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ASP.NET Core %}
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//To check whether the file is supported
FileStream stream = new FileStream("Sample.xls", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
var isSupported = application.IsSupported(stream);

excelEngine.Dispose();
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight Xamarin %}
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//To check whether the file is supported
FileStream stream = new FileStream("Sample.xls", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
var isSupported = application.IsSupported(stream);

excelEngine.Dispose();
{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
